                                    The virus COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected
                                    person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.
                                    These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or
                                    surfaces.
                                    You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of
                                    someone
                                    who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface.
